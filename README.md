### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
### Description:
TODO

### Process
1. While researching the libraries available, I found MIDI.js. Its tutorial works, but it is very undocumented and a little hard to use. So, I resorted to other libraries.
2. Finally, got reading and writing MIDI files to work. Now, I'll test the effects and start working on the UI.
3. Effects work like a charm! It's UI time.

### Libraries Used
+ soundfont-player
+ midi-file
+ FileSaver.js
+ tuna
+ Bootstrap
